## Contact Me

The college life is challenging, fun and trialing all tied up in a bow with a sprinkle of glitter. Confusing? How do you think we feel? Life is great as it is though: doing well in school, consistently exercising, working an internship, attending club activities, hanging out with friends, and exploring my passions in whatever freetime is left. 

Have questions about college or life in general? Contact me:
